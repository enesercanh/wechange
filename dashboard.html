                <p>By Sami Taha</p>
                <p>The American University of Iraq, Baghdad (AUIB) has launched an exciting new career fair program aimed at connecting students with leading employers and offering valuable career development opportunities. The event, held in the university's main atrium, welcomed over 30 companies from a variety of sectors, including technology, finance, healthcare, and engineering.</p>
                <p>The inaugural career fair, which took place last Friday, drew hundreds of students eager to explore potential job and internship opportunities. The program was designed to not only provide students with direct access to employers but also to offer workshops and seminars on career planning, resume building, and interview techniques.</p>
                <p>In his opening remarks, Dr. Nabil Shakir, President of AUIB, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between academic learning and professional success. "Our goal is to ensure that every student has the tools and resources they need to transition from the classroom to the workforce with confidence," Dr. Shakir stated.</p>
                <p>The career fair featured booths set up by top companies looking to recruit fresh talent from the university’s diverse pool of students. Among the prominent employers present were major corporations like Zain Iraq, Asiacell, and several international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Students were able to interact with company representatives, learn about available job opportunities, and submit their resumes for consideration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the career fair, the event also included several workshops on entrepreneurship, personal branding, and job market trends, giving students a well-rounded experience to help them navigate the competitive job market in Iraq.</p>
                <p>The success of the event has already led to plans for expanding the program in the coming years, with AUIB hoping to engage even more companies and offer additional services to support students in their career development. "We want to be a part of our students' journey, not just academically but professionally as well," said Dr. Shakir.</p>
                <p>For many students, the career fair provided a valuable opportunity to meet potential employers and learn about the skills and qualifications required to succeed in the workforce. "I’m really excited about the potential to work with companies that are actively recruiting. The workshops were also helpful in guiding me on how to improve my resume and job application process," said Layla Abdulrahman, a senior student in the business program.</p>
                <p>The new career fair program is expected to become a regular feature at AUIB, providing students with essential resources to help them achieve their career goals and strengthen their connections with the professional community.</p>
